# Ladino diksionaryo

The source data of the Ladino dictionary here: https://diksionaryo.szabgab.com/


The code that generates the web site can be found in https://github.com/djudezmo-org/ladino-diksionaryo-code/

The words are found in the [words] subdrirectory.

There are separate pages in the [pajinas] directory.

`Diksionario biervos excel corrected.xlsx` was the orginal file received from the Ladinokomunity.
It was exported to `diksionario_biervos_excel_corrected.csv` where a few small things were fixed.
These files are not used any more but were left in the repository for historical reasons.
`export_words_from_ladinokomunita.py` was used to export the data.

The `course` directory is a copy of the LibreLingo Ladino course.
The content needs to be integrated into the `words` and then this directory can be deleted.
